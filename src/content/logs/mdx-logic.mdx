This document explains the automated logic and strict design rules that govern the Studio's content.

## 1. Auto-Progress (The Magic Bar)

You **don't** need to set up progress bars manually. The system does it for you.

### How It Works
*   The system scans your post for checkboxes.
*   Finds any `- [ ]` (todo) or `- [x]` (done)?
*   It calculates the percentage and shows a progress bar on the card. Automatically.
*   **You don't configure anything.** Just write your checklist.

**Example:**
- [ ] Write the code
- [x] Test the code
- [ ] Deploy to prod

*(The system is reading these right now and calculating this post's progress)*

## 2. Divider Hierarchy (The Design Law)

To keep things clean, we follow a strict divider hierarchy. Don't use random dividers everywhere.

### Major Sections (H2)
Use the **Receipt Variant**. This is your structural separator.

```jsx
<DashedLine variant="receipt" />
```

### Subsections (H3)
Use **Whitespace**. No divider. Let the typography breathe.

### Widgets & Sidebars
Use the **Tech Variant**. This is for framed UI elements like the Activity Feed.

```jsx
<DashedLine variant="tech" />
```

## 3. Status Badges

The `status` field in your frontmatter controls the badge color and position.

*   **Focus**: Adds a "Focus" badge. **Effect**: Puts the post at the very top of the Home Feed. Use this for your current main objective.
*   **Active**: Green "Active" badge. For ongoing work.
*   **Paused**: Yellow "Paused" badge. For work on hold.
*   **Archived**: Grey badge. For completed or old logs.
*   **Busy**: Red "Busy" badge. For critical status.

## 4. Special Fields

### The Pinned Field
Set `pinned: true` and the post shows up in the "Pinned Logs" sidebar widget for quick access.

### The Progress Field (Reader Mode)
*   **`progress: false`**: Use this to enable **Reader Mode**.
    *   **Effect 1**: Hides the Progress Bar on the card.
    *   **Effect 2**: Switches the Modal View from "Task List" to "Table of Contents".
    *   **Use Case**: Essays, Documentation, or simple lists you don't want tracked.
*   **`progress: true`**: Forces the bar to show (Manual Override).
