# Status Pill System

We have implemented a dynamic status pill system to visually categorize Log Cards. Each status has a distinct color and animation profile.

## Supported Statuses

The system handles case-insensitive input (e.g., "Active", "active", "ACTIVE").

### 1. FOCUS
**Color:** Emerald (Green)
**Animation:** Ping (Halo Effect)
**Usage:** High priority item currently being worked on.
```yaml
status: "focus"
```

### 2. ACTIVE / IN_PROGRESS
**Color:** Blue
**Animation:** Ping (Halo Effect)
**Usage:** Standard active task.
```yaml
status: "active"
```

### 3. PENDING
**Color:** Amber (Orange)
**Animation:** Ping (Halo Effect)
**Usage:** Task waiting for review or external blocker.
```yaml
status: "pending"
```

### 4. PAUSED
**Color:** Red
**Animation:** None (Static Dot)
**Usage:** Task temporarily halted.
```yaml
status: "paused"
```

### 5. ARCHIVED
**Color:** Neutral (Gray)
**Animation:** None (Static Dot)
**Usage:** Old or deprecated items kept for record.
```yaml
status: "archived"
```

## Implementation Details

The `LogCard` component parses the `meta.status` field from the MDX frontmatter.
If the status is missing or unrecognized, it defaults to a neutral style with the raw text label.
