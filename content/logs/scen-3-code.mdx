## Security Layer

The handshake protocol ensures that no rogue nodes can join the mesh without a signed certificate from the central authority. We have implemented a rotating key mechanism that refreshes every hour.

<CodeBlock
  filename="ARCH_DUMP.LOG"
  className="bg-neutral-50 my-6"
  code={`{
  "handshake_id": "HS_99_ALPHA",
  "cypher": "AES-256",
  "ttl": 3600,
  "status": "NEGOTIATED"
}`}
/>

We are currently monitoring the latency impact of the new cipher suite.
