## The Brief

Infrastructure in South Sumatra faces unique geographical challenges. The project was commissioned to address data synchronization latencies across 14 remote sectors. The primary goal was to ensure `99.9% uptime` despite intermittent terrestrial backbone failures.

* Map existing dead-zones and signal interference patterns.
* Deploy 24 mesh-node relays across Lahat district.
* Integrate GIS-driven real-time monitoring dashboard.
